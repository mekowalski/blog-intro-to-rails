CONTROLLER
  -receive specific requests for the application
  -routing decides which controller receives which requests
  -often more than 1 route to each controller
  -different routes can be served by different action
  -actions collect info to provide it to a view
  -controllers and routes work closely together
  -controller sits in the middle and controls the data flow back and forth between models and views

VIEWS
  -displays information in readable format, seen web page
  -controller not view, where info is collected
  -view just displays the info
  -view templates written in ERB(embedded Ruby), can use Ruby and HTML in views

RAILS GENERATE
  -rails comes with a ton of useful/helpful generators
  -helps create controllers, models, etc
